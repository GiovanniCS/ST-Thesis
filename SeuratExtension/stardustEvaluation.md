# Stardust statistical evaluation
The figure below describe the CSSs distribution of 5 Stardust configurations (Lymph Node dataset). For the configuration '0.5' (i.e. distance based on space weights half of the distance based on transcriptional profiles) a statistical evaluation has been performed.

This script describes 100 clustering repetions. In each one the spot positions have been suffled and then Stardust has been applied.

Then we apply Wilcoxon and Kolmogorov statistical tests.  
We compare CSSs distributions between Stardust applied to the original dataset and Stardust applied to the same dataset with shuffled positions.  
Let x be the CSSs distribution for the original dataset and y be the CSSs distribution for the k-th shuffled dataset.  

Wilcoxon test:  
H0 = true location shift between x and y is equal to 0   
H1 = true location shift between x and y is greater than 0

Kolmogorov test:   
H0 =  the CDF of x does not lie below that of y  
H1 = the CDF of x lies below that of y  (and thus x is greater than y)  


P-values are corrected with Bonferroni for multiple hypothesis testing

print(paste("Kolmogorov: in ", sum(kolmogorov < (0.05/100)), " times over 100 the CDF of x lies below w.r.t. the CDF of y.",sep=""))

# Output:
# "Wilcoxon: in 100 times over 100 x is statistically higher w.r.t. to y"
# "Kolmogorov: in 100 times over 100 the CDF of x lies below w.r.t. the CDF of y."

In conclusion the increase in CSSs for "0.5" configuration of Stardust is statistically significative if compared with the results based on shuffled position of spots.

# All configurations
Repeating the above tests for all the configuration of Startust, we obtain the following results:

We can see that increasing the space weight, more null hypothesis are rejected.  
Also for kolmogorov-Smirnov test this trend is true but already at configuration 0 almost all null hypothesis are rejected. This may seems counter intuitive but analyzing 4 random comparison between CFD of scores for the original dataset and CDF of scores for shuffled dataset we can see that the distributions are basically the same and, thus, the test is not well suited to capture the similarity.
